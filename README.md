# Discussion

To discuss problems or issues that arise throughout the course, create a thread in the [issues](https://github.com/uc-cfss/Discussion/issues) of this repository. Tag your peers using their GitHub handle (e.g. `@bensoltoff`) to get their attention.

Once your issue has been solved, be sure to [close it](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Of course, this means you should use the search feature to make sure someone else hasn't already solved your problem.
